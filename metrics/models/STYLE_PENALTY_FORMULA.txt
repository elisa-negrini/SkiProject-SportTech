STYLE PENALTY MODEL
Predicts Style Points Lost Due to Biomechanical Flaws
============================================================

FORMULA:
----------------------------------------
Style_Penalty (points) =
    + 0.9664 x Landing Impact (66%)
    -0.4974 x Telemark Quality (34%)
    -0.0029 x Flight Stability (0%)
    + 3.5952 (intercept)

FEATURE DETAILS:
----------------------------------------

Landing Impact:
  Original metric: landing_hip_velocity
  Coefficient: 0.9664
  Description: Hip descent velocity at landing (higher = harder landing)
  Effect: Higher value -> MORE penalty

Telemark Quality:
  Original metric: telemark_scissor_mean
  Coefficient: -0.4974
  Description: Leg separation in telemark position (normalized)
  Effect: Higher value -> LESS penalty

Flight Stability:
  Original metric: flight_std
  Coefficient: -0.0029
  Description: Body-ski angle variation during flight (lower = more stable)
  Effect: Higher value -> LESS penalty


MODEL PERFORMANCE:
----------------------------------------
  R² = 0.165
  MAE = 1.52 points
  RMSE = 2.00 points
