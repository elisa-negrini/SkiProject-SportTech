STYLE PENALTY MODEL
Predicts Style Points Lost Due to Biomechanical Flaws
============================================================

FORMULA:
----------------------------------------
Style_Penalty (points) =
    -1.1592 x Telemark Quality (58%)
    + 0.5685 x Landing Impact (29%)
    -0.2538 x Flight Stability (13%)
    + 3.9000 (intercept)

FEATURE DETAILS:
----------------------------------------

Telemark Quality:
  Original metric: telemark_scissor_mean
  Coefficient: -1.1592
  Description: Leg separation in telemark position (normalized)
  Effect: Higher value -> LESS penalty

Landing Impact:
  Original metric: landing_hip_velocity
  Coefficient: 0.5685
  Description: Hip descent velocity at landing (higher = harder landing)
  Effect: Higher value -> MORE penalty

Flight Stability:
  Original metric: flight_std
  Coefficient: -0.2538
  Description: Body-ski angle variation during flight (lower = more stable)
  Effect: Higher value -> LESS penalty


MODEL PERFORMANCE:
----------------------------------------
  R² = 0.067
  MAE = 1.94 points
  RMSE = 2.60 points
