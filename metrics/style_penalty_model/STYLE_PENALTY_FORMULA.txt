STYLE PENALTY MODEL
Predicts Style Points Lost Due to Biomechanical Flaws
FORMULA:
Style_Penalty (points) =
    + 0.4489 x Telemark Quality (59%)
    -0.1994 x Landing Impact (26%)
    -0.1138 x Flight Stability (15%)
    + 3.8871 (intercept)

FEATURE DETAILS:
Telemark Quality:
  Original metric: telemark_scissor_mean
  Coefficient: 0.4489
  Description: Leg separation in telemark position (normalized)
  Effect: Higher value -> MORE penalty

Landing Impact:
  Original metric: landing_hip_velocity
  Coefficient: -0.1994
  Description: Hip descent velocity at landing (higher = harder landing)
  Effect: Higher value -> LESS penalty

Flight Stability:
  Original metric: flight_std
  Coefficient: -0.1138
  Description: Body-ski angle variation during flight (lower = more stable)
  Effect: Higher value -> LESS penalty
