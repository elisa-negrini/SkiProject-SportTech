STYLE PENALTY MODEL
Predicts Style Points Lost Due to Biomechanical Flaws
============================================================

FORMULA:
----------------------------------------
Style_Penalty (points) =
    -0.5575 x Telemark Quality (45%)
    + 0.4411 x Flight Stability (36%)
    -0.2389 x Landing Impact (19%)
    + 3.8833 (intercept)

FEATURE DETAILS:
----------------------------------------

Telemark Quality:
  Original metric: telemark_scissor_mean
  Coefficient: -0.5575
  Description: Leg separation in telemark position (normalized)
  Effect: Higher value -> LESS penalty

Flight Stability:
  Original metric: flight_std
  Coefficient: 0.4411
  Description: Body-ski angle variation during flight (lower = more stable)
  Effect: Higher value -> MORE penalty

Landing Impact:
  Original metric: landing_hip_velocity
  Coefficient: -0.2389
  Description: Hip descent velocity at landing (higher = harder landing)
  Effect: Higher value -> LESS penalty


MODEL PERFORMANCE:
----------------------------------------
  R² = -0.560
  MAE = 2.25 points
  RMSE = 3.11 points
