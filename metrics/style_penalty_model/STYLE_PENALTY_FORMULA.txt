STYLE PENALTY MODEL
Predicts Style Points Lost Due to Biomechanical Flaws
FORMULA:
Style_Penalty (points) =
    + 1.3530 x Landing Absorption Quality (77%)
    + 0.2688 x Telemark Position (15%)
    + 0.1338 x Flight Stability (8%)
    + 3.8871 (intercept)

FEATURE DETAILS:
Landing Absorption Quality:
  Original metric: landing_knee_compression
  Coefficient: 1.3530
  Description: Knee flexion during landing (degrees)
  Effect: Higher value -> MORE penalty

Telemark Position:
  Original metric: telemark_scissor_mean
  Coefficient: 0.2688
  Description: Leg separation in telemark landing (normalized)
  Effect: Higher value -> MORE penalty

Flight Stability:
  Original metric: flight_std
  Coefficient: 0.1338
  Description: Body-ski angle standard deviation during flight (degrees)
  Effect: Higher value -> MORE penalty
